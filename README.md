## GatherTogether: 
### Your Social Media Platform for Hosting Events  
*Would you like to create an event but don't know how to tell your friends about it?  
Are you bored and don't know where to go and what to do?*  
Our application system ***will be*** perfect for you: It allows users to host events and send invitations to their friends. Users can search for events by location, time and categories, and they can request invitations from the host for the events they are interested in. Afterwards participants can review the event and the host and upload the pictures they have taken there, as well as see what other people uploaded.  
  
Below you can find the design documents for our system and the progress reports.
